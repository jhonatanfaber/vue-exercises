> In this project I'm using Vuex to centralize state management and Vue router to create a Single-page Application.

You have an initial amount of funds. Every time you buy a new item, that amount will decrease or not, depending on your selling and buying.
You can also 'end day' and the price of the items will change. If you wish, you can save your purchase so that you can load it later.
If you want to buy and do not have funds enough , an error will be shown.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

```
